           <h3>The purpose of selecting this website</h3><hr>
           <p>The only reason we, the citizens of India, are enjoying our lives without worrying about our security is all thanks to the Indian Army protecting our nation at the border. Fighting terrorism and illegal immigration, risking their lives for us, they are on guard, night and day, come hail or storm. 
            <br>But how well do we know our Indian army? If we can't do anything to make their lives better, atleast we can respect and salute them for all their might, isn't it? The more we know our army, the more pride we'll have for them.
            <br>This is the reason for creating this website.</p>
