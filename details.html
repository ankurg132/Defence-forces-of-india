                <p><br>The Indian Army is the land-based branch and the largest component of the Indian Armed Forces. 
                  The President of India is the Supreme Commander of the Indian Army, and its professional head is the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), who is a four-star general. 
                  <br>Two officers have been conferred with the rank of field marshal, a five-star rank, which is a ceremonial position of great honour. 
                  The Indian Army originated from the armies of the East India Company, which eventually became the British Indian Army, and the armies of the princely states, which were merged into the national army after independence. 
                  <br>The units and regiments of the Indian Army have diverse histories and have participated in a number of battles and campaigns around the world, earning many battle and theatre honours before and after Independence.

                  <br>The Indian Navy is the naval branch of the Indian Armed Forces. The President of India is the Supreme Commander of the Indian Navy. 
                  The Chief of Naval Staff, a four-star admiral, commands the navy.
                  The Indian Navy traces its origins back to the East India Company's Marine which was founded in 1612 to protect British merchant shipping in the region. In 1793, the British East India Company established its rule over eastern part of the Indian subcontinent i.e. Bengal, but it was not until 1830 that the colonial navy was titled as His Majesty's Indian Navy. 
                  When India became a republic in 1950, the Royal Indian Navy as it had been named since 1934 was renamed to Indian Navy.

                  <br>The Indian Air Force (IAF) is the air arm of the Indian Armed Forces. Its complement of personnel and aircraft assets ranks fourth amongst the air forces of the world.
                  <br>Its primary mission is to secure Indian airspace and to conduct aerial warfare during armed conflict. It was officially established on 8 October 1932 as an auxiliary air force of the British Empire which honoured India's aviation service during World War II with the prefix Royal.
                  After India gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1947, the name Royal Indian Air Force was kept and served in the name of Dominion of India. 
                  With the government's transition to a Republic in 1950, the prefix Royal was removed.
                  Since 1950 the IAF has been involved in four wars with neighbouring Pakistan and one with the People's Republic of China. 
                  Other major operations undertaken by the IAF include Operation Vijay, Operation Meghdoot, Operation Cactus and Operation Poomalai. The IAF's mission expands beyond engagement with hostile forces, with the IAF participating in United Nations peacekeeping missions.
